I run all my experiments on Windows 2012 server R2 with python 3.8. torch 1.8.1, torch_geometric 1.7.0, igraph 0.9.1, snap.py installed.

The GGCN is from https://github.com/StatsDLMathsRecomSys/Generative-Graph-Convolutional-Network-for-Growing-Graphs.

The kronem.exe is complied by VS 2017 with some changes based on SNAP's kronem example from https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap/blob/master/examples/kronem/
